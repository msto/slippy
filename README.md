## Why "slippy"?

`slippy` first came to mind as the "Simple Snakemake Linter". "SSL" is already taken, but `ssl.py` could sound like "slippy". 

And `slippy` is helpful, like everybody's favorite digital assistant who also rhymes with "lippy".

And [Rust did it first](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/clippy/usage.html).
